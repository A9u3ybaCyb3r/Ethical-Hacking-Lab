# Virtual-Network-Penetration-Testing-Lab

## Objective

The lab focuses on providing a safe and controlled space to practice various security skills, including network security, penetration testing, and defensive strategies. By building virtual machines and configuring a network with a firewall, you can simulate real-world scenarios and gain hands-on experience with security tools and techniques.

### Skills Learned

- Virtualization: Installing and configuring VirtualBox software, creating and managing virtual machines (VMs), allocating resources to VMs, and installing guest operating systems.
- Network Security: Understanding network concepts (VLANs, subnets, IP addressing), configuring virtual networks with pfSense firewall, setting up network segmentation, and implementing network security controls.
- Penetration Testing: Importing pre-configured vulnerable machines (VulnHub) and Kali Linux for practicing penetration testing techniques.
- Active Directory: Building a simulated Active Directory environment to understand directory services and practice potential attack vectors.
- Security Analysis: Utilizing tools like pfSense firewall for network traffic control.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used


- VirtualBox: A virtualization software platform used to create and manage virtual machines.
- pfSense: An open-source firewall software used to create a secure network gateway for the virtual lab environment.
- Kali Linux: A Linux distribution pre-loaded with various security and penetration testing tools.
- VulnHub: A repository of pre-configured vulnerable virtual machines for practicing penetration testing techniques.
- Windows Server:
- Windows 10: 

## Steps

### Planning Phase
1. First we will build a network diagram to represent our lab visually.

Do not forget to install the extension pack

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40457f5e-4417-4b4b-b642-f0c4c704617e)

2. Click on the file that you downloaded and just go with the default settings.
3. Open the application, go to File, then Tools, then the Extention Pack Manager.

### Building a pfSense VM

1. First we download the file that we need. 
 - Go to this link: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A*.netgate.com+download+-site%3Aforum.netgate.com+-site%3Adocs.netgate.com+-inurl%3Ablog+-site%3Awww.netgate.com+-site%3Ashop.netgate.com+-site%3Aforums.netgate.com+-site%3Ainfo.netgate.com&ref=benheater.com

Choose this one.

Then we choose the latest version.

2. Extract the file, in this case I will be using 7-zip.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b395d9a3-6e1c-4d7d-a32f-352084f731eb)

3. Create a New Machine

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1bed139-45f7-4864-9d89-74ef542fc0cc)

Name your vm, choose the folder that you want to save the machine, choose the iso image that you want to use, and select the type and version of the VM.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e73ca9a0-ee82-4aff-83a5-d966640e2c60)

!!Do not start the VM yet!!

4. Go to the settings of the machine

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/783117c5-c6c4-42d2-81c3-d70b5ce5d8fb)

Change the boot order and match it as in the image shown below. Also, uncheck the Floppy Disk 
This will ensure that the operating system boots upon installation from the disc.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f69d55aa-465c-4616-a2cb-ceac898494ef)

Go to the audio settings and disable the audio

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0677dd7d-2d4d-4383-8697-01d8fe5b8c04)

Go to the USB settings and disable it.

![image-38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cf67d2e-ebd6-4c6e-ab83-f49f87a27b82)

3. Right-click the machine and choose the Network settings.

![cd25168f5bf7404cb6e4d5a8b84ca441](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/465b1135-d2b9-4e79-aa75-f6eb9f315ed1)

Change the network settings to the pfSense LAN network that you created.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82294fe3-d42c-44cb-8982-732ef4d9e3aa)

Then increase your RAM depending on how much you need. Mine is 8GB RAM because of the tools that I use. You can do it on the machine settings. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cf482b6-64c7-48be-8248-fe25ad5868eb)

4. Click OK and now you can start the machine. Use the default credentials of kali:kali

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/919a0fe4-12fe-4847-acad-0180f51a77b8)

5. Open the terminal to see if we are on the LAN network. Our IP Address should be 10.19.19.X/24. Later we can set up the IP Address that we you want later.
