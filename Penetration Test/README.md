# Overview

Welcome! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to performing both external and internal penetration tests. It showcases my skills in cybersecurity, network analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Each folder contains essential documentation, including attack reports and network diagrams that detail the methodology and findings of the tests conducted.

## Objective

The primary objective of this directory is to provide a structured approach to penetration testing, illustrating both the techniques employed and the results obtained. By documenting these processes, I aim to enhance my skills and contribute to the knowledge base of the cybersecurity community. This repository can also serve as a reference for security professionals and organizations looking to understand the intricacies of penetration testing.

## Folder Structure

The directory consists of two main folders:

### 1. External Penetration Test

This folder contains resources related to testing the security of an organization's perimeter defenses. The key components include:

- **Attack Report**: A detailed analysis of vulnerabilities discovered during the external penetration test, along with remediation recommendations.
- **Network Diagram**: A visual representation of the target network architecture, illustrating the systems and services exposed to the public internet.

### 2. Internal Penetration Test

This folder focuses on assessing the security of an organization's internal network. Key components include:

- **Attack Report**: An in-depth evaluation of vulnerabilities identified during the internal penetration test, including potential impacts and suggested mitigations.
- **Network Diagram**: A comprehensive diagram showcasing the internal network layout, highlighting critical assets and potential attack vectors.

## Skills Showcase

Through this repository, I demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

- **Penetration Testing Methodologies**: Understanding and applying various frameworks and methodologies for effective penetration testing.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying and analyzing security weaknesses in both external and internal environments.
- **Reporting and Documentation**: Creating clear and actionable reports that communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
- **Network Architecture Analysis**: Visualizing network layouts to understand potential attack vectors and security postures.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the folders and utilize the provided resources for your own learning or projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!

## Disclaimer

All tests and techniques documented in this repository were conducted within a controlled home lab environment. **Do not attempt these techniques on any systems or networks without explicit permission**. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.
