# Virtual-Network-Penetration-Testing-Lab

## Objective

The lab focuses on providing a safe and controlled space to practice various security skills, including network security, penetration testing, and defensive strategies. By building virtual machines and configuring a network with a firewall, you can simulate real-world scenarios and gain hands-on experience with security tools and techniques.

## Folders

This repository contains two main folders:

### 1. Building The Lab

This folder includes documentation and steps on how to set up the lab environment, detailing the installation and configuration of the necessary software and virtual machines.

### 2. Penetration Test

This folder contains resources related to performing penetration tests, including attack methodologies, reports, and tools used during the testing process.

## Skills Learned

- **Virtualization**: Installing and configuring VirtualBox software, creating and managing virtual machines (VMs), allocating resources to VMs, and installing guest operating systems.
- **Network Security**: Understanding network concepts (VLANs, subnets, IP addressing), configuring virtual networks with pfSense firewall, setting up network segmentation, and implementing network security controls.
- **Penetration Testing**: Importing pre-configured vulnerable machines (VulnHub) and Kali Linux for practicing penetration testing techniques.
- **Active Directory**: Building a simulated Active Directory environment to understand directory services and practice potential attack vectors.
- **Security Analysis**: Utilizing tools like pfSense firewall for network traffic control.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Report Writing.

## Tools Used

- **VirtualBox**: A virtualization software platform used to create and manage virtual machines.
- **pfSense**: An open-source firewall software used to create a secure network gateway for the virtual lab environment.
- **Kali Linux**: A Linux distribution pre-loaded with various security and penetration testing tools.
- **VulnHub**: A repository of pre-configured vulnerable virtual machines for practicing penetration testing techniques.
- **HackMyVM**: A platform that provides a collection of intentionally vulnerable virtual machines designed for practicing penetration testing and cybersecurity skills.
- **Windows Server 2019**: Used as the Domain Controller (DC) to host Active Directory.
- **Windows 10**: Used as a client machine to join the domain and interact with the AD environment.
- **Draw.io**: Used to draw and document the network topology and lab setup.
